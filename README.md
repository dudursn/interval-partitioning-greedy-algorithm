# interval-partitioning-greedy-algorithm
This implementation, which uses Java, consists in solving the interval partitioning problem using greedy algorithm.

# Interval partitioning:

In greedy algorithm problem, there is problem is known as interval partitioning problem and it goes like: There are n lectures to be schedules and there are 
certain number of classrooms. Each lecture has a start time si and finish time fi. Task is to schedule all lectures in minimum number of classes and there 
cannot be more than one lecture in a classroom at a given point of time.

- Lecture j starts at sj and finishes at fj.
- Goal: find minimum number of classrooms to schedule all lectures so that no two occur at the same time in the same room.(ignore overlap at start/finish)
